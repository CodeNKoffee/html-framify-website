# Framify - Image Navigation for Device Framesets

**Framify** is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies the process of showcasing screenshots and images within device framesets. It provides a user-friendly way to present your application or website visuals without the need for complex component libraries.

## Features

* **Supports various device framesets:** Customize the appearance using CSS to match your desired device frames (e.g., phones, tablets).
* **Enables navigation between multiple screenshots/images:** Users can easily navigate through a collection of screenshots or images within the frame.
* **(Optional) Touch swipe gestures for mobile browsing:** Enhance the user experience on mobile devices by allowing users to swipe through images. (Implementation details depend on your chosen approach)
* **Easy integration with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS:** Framify seamlessly integrates with your existing project structure, requiring minimal code changes.

## Installation

1. Download the Framify library files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the project repository (link to be provided).
2. Include the downloaded files in your project directory:

   ```bash
   project-directory/
     framify.html
     framify.css
     framify.js
     // Your other project files
   ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Framify in your HTML project:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Project Screenshots</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="framify.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="framify-container">
    <img src="screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot 1">
    <img src="screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot 2">
    <img src="screenshot3.png" alt="Screenshot 3">
  </div>
  <script src="framify.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code includes the Framify CSS and JS files and creates a container with your screenshots. You can customize the styles and behavior using CSS and vanilla JS.
